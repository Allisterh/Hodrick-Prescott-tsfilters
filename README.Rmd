## Example

Separate trend and cyclical component of univariate time series using the method proposed by Hamilton (2018, doi:10.1162/rest_a_00706).
```{r example}
library(tsfilters)
data(INDPRO, package="tsfilters")
IP_filtered <- hfilter(log(INDPRO), h=24, p=12)
IP_filtered
plot(IP_filtered)

# The first difference of logarithmized series:
IP_logdiff <- logdiff(INDPRO)
plot(IP_logdiff)
```
